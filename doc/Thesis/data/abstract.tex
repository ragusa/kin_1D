\chapter*{ABSTRACT}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{ABSTRACT} % Needs to be set to part, so the TOC doesnt add 'CHAPTER ' prefix in the TOC.

\pagestyle{plain} % No headers, just page numbers
\pagenumbering{roman} % Roman numerals
\setcounter{page}{2}

\indent Going to finish this when I finish the rest of the paper.
